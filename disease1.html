        <h2>CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE</h2>
        <h4>Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition. 
          Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries and inflammation are usually the cause of coronary artery disease.
          Signs and symptoms of coronary artery disease occur when the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. 
          If you have coronary artery disease, reduced blood flow to the heart can cause chest pain (angina) and shortness of breath.

        <h2>HEART ATTACK</h2>
        <h4>A heart attack occurs when an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart is blocked. 
          Fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits build up over time, forming plaques in the heart's arteries.
           If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. The clot can block arteries, causing a heart attack.
           During a heart attack, a lack of blood flow causes the tissue in the heart muscle to die.

        <h2>HEART FAILURE</h2>
        <h4>Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should.
          When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.
          Certain heart conditions gradually leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump blood properly. 
          These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure.

          It's also called hypertension. If you have high blood pressure, the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high.

<li>Bradycardia (brad-e-KAHR-dee-uh) is a slow heartbeat. The heart rate is less than 60 beats a minute.</li>
